I'm an aspiring scientist and entrepreneur based in Paris, France. My main goal is to become a builder at the intersection between software, hardware, and human well-being. One of my side-quests is to share my journey with you.

### Bio

As a child, my love for Minecraft mods quickly got me into coding. I started learning Java at around 10 years old, but I never though I would make a career of it. Growing up in Guatemala, I didn't see many people with tech jobs around me, and I thought it was something everyone just did for fun.

I moved to France when I was a teenager. During that time, personal health issues had the side effect of making me tremendously interested by how my own body and mind worked, so I started reading about biology and pharmacology. This made me realize that if I studied pharmacy, I could one day invent new drugs and improve the lives of many people.

In college, I loved going deep on the scientific subjects that got me into pharma school. However, I also saw that nowadays, a lot of the people doing really cool things in biology are coders. I decided that I was not going to stay in the sidelines, and thus I became one of those people.
